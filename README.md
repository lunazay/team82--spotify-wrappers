## Description of Project Domain
Our project's domain is a personalized stats reporter specific to a user's listening activity on Spotify.

### Description of Application
Our project will utilize Spotify's developer API to generate a stats page for a user which compiles and describes their listening activity by displaying frequently listened to artists, songs, and albums and organizing data with categories such as language and genre. Other web apps for Spotify stats exist, but they generally provide an in depth look into one aspect of a user's listening activity. Our application will focus on providing a generalized overview of listening activity in several organizational categories.
