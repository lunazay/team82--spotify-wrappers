## Description of Project Domain
Our project's domain is a personalized stats reporter specific to a user's listening activity on Spotify.

### Description of Application
Our project will utilize Spotify's developer API to generate a stats page for a user which compiles and describes their listening activity by displaying frequently listened to artists, songs, and albums and organizing data with categories such as language and genre. Other web apps for Spotify stats exist, but they generally provide an in depth look into one aspect of a user's listening activity. Our application will focus on providing a generalized overview of listening activity in several organizational categories.

## API

Spotify Web API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api

### Usage
Postman call to the API:

Errors faced when running Java code:

Java code snippet:
```java
/**OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder()
  .build();
MediaType mediaType = MediaType.parse("text/plain");
RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(mediaType, "");
Request request = new Request.Builder()
  .url("https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/new-releases")
  .method("GET", body)
  .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer BQCVwBhtZtx55QdA1TTis_e3YcA_7W7AGT1i10nK-okb-jlts2Em3p11aQpRTWV83XF9CQHUOcy_-jJ8nEFIVe5vrFll3M9t6kqOQwyh3i6NfVJe9b6-7Q4WuSDFfIUrXiNNrwfDYJjkwR6_irP6S15twTLiw0cfSc9-RiV5uBExv1NdtlFfIo9jfob2S1u2Bs_s3SNmpId0PwHBP0Mxv6UXQvjOw9NbCwjmYf2uH5R20SQ2C2BRm5MglMGJQ4fN9c6pQ8UxrpkaYA")
  .build();
Response response = client.newCall(request).execute(); **/
```

## Technical Problems
Implementing the API call into Java, we got the code snippet off Postman, but are unable to work through the errors we are facing.
